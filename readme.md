# NXTPG Protocol 
`The Next Page Protocol` (NPP) enables web pages to have a richer and more dynamic navigation experience allowing web pages to communicate relevant information according to a pages context.

Similar to Open Graph that allows a webpage to behave like an object with static information. NPP adds the ability for web pages to share information relative to each other.
